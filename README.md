kml_proxy
=========

This is a very simple server implementation that is used to convert KML strings into documents that can be downloaded.

The Google V3 KML object does not allow for string data at the time of creation and only allows URLs. For this reason I created this proxy server. 

It is very basic and should be used with caution.
